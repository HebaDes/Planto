## User Flow

The user flow for the Plant Care Reminder App is structured to ensure that both new and returning users can easily navigate and set up plant reminders. Below is a breakdown of the flow:

1. **Splash Screen**: Entry point for the app where the user decides to start or continue.
2. **New User Check**:
   - If the user is new, they are directed to the **Main Page** in an empty state to begin adding reminders.
   - If the user is returning, they are taken directly to the **Main Page** with existing plant reminders.
3. **Main Page**:
   - Users can add new plant reminders, edit existing reminders, or delete reminders that are no longer needed.
4. **Add Reminder**:
   - Users enter plant-specific details (such as plant type, care instructions, and reminder frequency).
   - After entering details, the user is prompted to confirm if they want to save the information.
5. **Save or Cancel**:
   - If the user chooses to save, the information is stored and the reminder is activated.
   - If the user cancels, they are returned to the previous screen without saving changes.
